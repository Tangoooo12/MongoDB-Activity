Schema Flexibility in MongoDB vs. SQL:
MongoDB has no enforced schema - documents in the same collection can have different fields
SQL requires predefined tables and columns with specific data types
You can easily add fields to some documents without affecting others

Pros and Cons of Flexible Schemas:
Pros: Easier to evolve data models, handle diverse data, faster development
Cons: Potential for inconsistent data, more validation needed in application code

When to Choose NoSQL over SQL:
For semi-structured or unstructured data
When schema needs to evolve frequently
For large-scale applications requiring horizontal scaling
When working with JSON data from web applications
For rapid development and prototyping
